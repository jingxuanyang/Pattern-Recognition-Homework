## Introduction

This is homework 1 of Pattern Recognition.

## Structure

The directory of this homework is as follows.

```matlab

## Quick Start

1. Run `drawDecisionSurface.m` for Problem 4.1 to draw Bayes decision boundary.
2. Run `drawDecisionSurface2.m` for Problem 4.2 to draw Bayes decision boundary.
3. Run `drawDecisionSurface3.m` for Problem 4.3 to draw Bayes decision boundary.
4. Run `drawDecisionSurface4.m` for Problem 4.4 to draw Bayes decision boundary.
5. Run `drawPosteriorProb.m` for Problem 1.3 to draw posterior probability density function.
6. Run `naiveBayesCalculation.m` for Problem Naive Bayes to numerically calculate probabilities.
